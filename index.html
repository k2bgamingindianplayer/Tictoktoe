     RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</center>
     1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.<br><br>
     
     2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.<br><br>
     
     3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.<br><br>
     
     4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.<br><br>

           HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</center><br><br><br>
     To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.
     
     Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.
     
     After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.
     
     You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.
     
     If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.
